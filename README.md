This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error involving improper handling of null values and non-numeric inputs.  The `bug.js` file shows the initial code with the error, while `bugSolution.js` presents a corrected version. The improved version explicitly checks for null inputs and throws clear error messages for invalid data types, making debugging easier and preventing unexpected behavior.  This example showcases best practices for robust error handling in JavaScript.
